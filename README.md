## The longest path problem
> [!NOTE]
> In graph theory and theoretical computer science, the **longest path problem** between two given vertices $s$ and $t$ in a graph $G$ is the problem of finding a simple path of maximum length in a given graph. A path is called simple if it does not have any repeated vertices; the length of a path may either be measured by its number of edges, or (in weighted graphs) by the sum of the weights of its edges.
